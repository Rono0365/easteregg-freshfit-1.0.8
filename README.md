important command that i keep on forgeting
#flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
Also if you are from the future and want ot use this software on android 
do the following:

delete android folder since packages you'll most likely have are newer than mine
then  create a random app using "Flutter create <examplename>" then enter the folder move the android folder to your the original path
